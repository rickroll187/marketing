The previous AI engineer effectively transformed an MVP into a specialized affiliate marketing platform for the tech/SaaS niche. The core effort involved resolving a critical, persistent input focus bug, which proved to be a deep React reconciliation issue, exacerbated by PostHog's session recording and the  component's complexity. This was ultimately fixed by completely disabling PostHog and implementing isolated, state-managed input components (, , ).

Following bug resolution, the engineer successfully integrated new features: a Tech/SaaS Program Discovery tab with curated free programs, and a Real-Time Tracking Dashboard (enhancing the Analytics+ tab). Phase 2 involved adding Simplified Link Management and Automated Commission Tracking (into the Prices tab), and integrating a user's approved GEARit Rakuten program. The work is currently progressing into Phase 3, focusing on Tech Platform Integrations, Fraud Detection Alerts, and Single-User Engagement Features.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was an affiliate marketing platform to scrape tech products, generate multi-platform content (videos, blogs) for social media to drive Amazon affiliate sales, and include social media automation, content scheduling, performance analytics, and SendGrid email marketing. A crucial URL management system was needed for processing product URLs without input limits and preventing unwanted tab navigation shifts. Later, the user explicitly requested integrating 10 competitive advantages (AI price tracking, advanced analytics, social media automation, etc.) while maintaining cost-effectiveness (free-tier solutions).

The application has since been enhanced for a single tech/SaaS affiliate marketer. New requirements include: a curated list of high-commission/beginner-friendly tech/SaaS affiliate programs with details and search; a real-time tracking dashboard (clicks, conversions, earnings, top links, CSV export); lightweight fraud detection alerts; integrations with WordPress, HubSpot, Google Analytics, and one-click social media link generation; an intuitive link management interface with short links and custom tracking; direct access to affiliate networks (CJ, ShareASale, Awin) for browsing and tracking; automated commission tracking (recurring, per-sale, flat-rate) with payout estimates; and single-user engagement features like onboarding tutorials and motivational notifications.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing Phase 3 features, focusing on enhancing the user experience and platform integrations. The previous significant work successfully resolved a critical and persistent input focus issue across the entire application. This bug, where users had to click input fields after every character, was traced to PostHog's session recording interfering with DOM events and a deep React re-rendering problem in the main  component. The fix involved completely disabling PostHog and implementing highly isolated input components like , , and  that manage their own state with  to prevent re-renders from affecting focus.

Following this, the engineer successfully added major new features:
1.  **Tech/SaaS Program Discovery**: A new Programs tab () was added, displaying 15 curated free affiliate programs with details, search, and category filters.
2.  **Real-Time Tracking Dashboard**: The Analytics+ tab was enhanced with a  component, showing mock real-time clicks, conversions, earnings, and top-performing links.
3.  **Simplified Link Management**: A new Links tab () was implemented, allowing users to generate short links and custom tracking codes.
4.  **Automated Commission Tracking**: The Prices tab was enhanced with a  component to display mock pending and confirmed earnings for various commission types.
5.  **GEARit Program Integration**: A user-approved GEARit affiliate program through Rakuten was added to the programs database in .

The current task, as per the user's request (go with phase 3), involves continuing the implementation of the remaining Phase 3 features. So far,  and  have been created, and the engineer was just about to create the  component.
