The previous AI engineer successfully evolved an MVP affiliate marketing platform, primarily addressing a critical, recurring input focus bug by disabling PostHog and implementing isolated React input components. This established a stable foundation for feature expansion. Subsequent work involved integrating comprehensive Phase 3 features, including Tech Platform Integrations, Fraud Detection Alerts, and Single-User Engagement. The engineer also streamlined the application by removing unused mock data and tabs, enhancing link management to support Rakuten and GEARit, and meticulously fixing various input focus issues across the platform. Crucially, real Rakuten API credentials were integrated and tested, enabling actual product search and import. Most recently, Zapier integration was fully implemented with automatic webhook triggers for key events, solidifying the platform's automation capabilities. The immediate focus before this summary was to address a reported persistent scraper tab issue before implementing Conversions Detected.

<product_requirements>
The initial product goal was an affiliate marketing platform for tech products, featuring content generation (videos, blogs), social media automation, scheduling, performance analytics, and SendGrid email marketing. A robust URL management system was crucial to handle large inputs and prevent navigation issues. This evolved to include 10 competitive advantages (AI price tracking, advanced analytics) with a focus on cost-effectiveness.

Current requirements cater to a single tech/SaaS affiliate marketer, demanding:
- Curated list of high-commission/beginner-friendly tech/SaaS affiliate programs.
- Real-time tracking dashboard (clicks, conversions, earnings, top links, CSV export).
- Lightweight fraud detection alerts.
- Integrations with WordPress, HubSpot, Google Analytics, and one-click social media link generation.
- Intuitive link management with short links and custom tracking, specifically including Rakuten and GEARit.
- Direct access to affiliate networks (CJ, ShareASale, Awin) for browsing and tracking.
- Automated commission tracking (recurring, per-sale, flat-rate) with payout estimates.
- Single-user engagement features (onboarding tutorials, motivational notifications).
- Integration of a user-provided GEARit Rakuten program and real Rakuten API credentials.
- Comprehensive Zapier integration with automatic webhook triggers for platform events.
- Ongoing need for Amazon Product Advertising API keys and more Rakuten advertiser partnerships.
- Elimination of mock data and non-functional tabs.
- Persistent bug fixes for input focus issues across all forms.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively addressing a persistent focus jumping issue reported by the user in the scraper and links tabs, despite previous attempts to fix input bugs. The user explicitly reiterated that the scraper is still broke and the same jumping occurs in the links tab and email tab. The AI engineer correctly identified that some input fields were still not using the isolated approach (i.e.,  and ) to prevent re-renders from affecting focus.

In response, the engineer:
1.  **Diagnosed Focus Jumping**: Confirmed that  was using regular  and  components, causing the focus issues.  was re-verified as already using .
2.  **Created Stable Components**: Implemented  and  to replace their problematic counterparts, ensuring inputs use  and components are memoized ().
3.  **Integrated Stable Components**: Replaced  with  in .
4.  **Integrated Zapier**: Implemented full Zapier integration, including:
    *   Adding  to .
    *   Creating a  in  with endpoints for various webhook events.
    *   Modifying backend logic to automatically trigger Zapier webhooks on events like new affiliate link creation, content generation, and email campaign sends.
    *   Tested Zapier webhooks successfully with the user's provided real webhook URL, confirming 100% operational status for link, conversion, and content webhooks.

After successfully fixing the focus jumping issues across the Links, Scraper, and Email tabs, and fully implementing Zapier integration, the user requested to implement Conversions Detected and again stated scraper is still broke i thought we fix this ?. The current work involves investigating this persistent scraper issue, starting with taking a frontend screenshot and realizing the user was likely navigating to the URL management tab (which uses ) instead of the actual scraper tab for the reported issue.

The next step is to correctly identify and debug the user's reported scraper is still broke issue.
