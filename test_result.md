# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Despite multiple sophisticated fix attempts (FocusSafeTextarea, ExternalTextarea, PortalTextarea with complete DOM isolation), the issue persists. Root cause analysis reveals React is unmounting/remounting textarea components after each input event, destroying DOM elements entirely. Even with React.memo(() => true) and stable callbacks, components are recreated. Console logs show 'PortalTextarea cleaned up' → 'PortalTextarea created' cycle after every character. This is a deep React reconciliation issue in App.js component structure causing complete child component recreation, not just re-rendering."

Tested successfully: typed 71-character URL + multiline functionality (133 total chars) without ANY focus loss. Root cause was complex App.js state management (30+ useState variables) causing aggressive React reconciliation. Solution: Created isolated components with internal state management that communicate via callbacks only when needed. The IsolatedUrlInput component uses React.memo(() => true) and manages its own state independently from parent App component, preventing re-renders that destroy DOM elements. This architectural approach successfully isolates input components from the parent's re-render cycles."

  - message: "🏆 CRITICAL INPUT FOCUS BUG COMPLETELY RESOLVED! After extensive investigation and multiple approaches (FocusSafeTextarea, ExternalTextarea, PortalTextarea), discovered the root cause was complex App.js state management causing React reconciliation issues. Successfully implemented IsolatedUrlInput component with internal state management that completely bypasses parent re-render cycles. Testing results: ✅ Typed 71-character URL without any focus loss ✅ Multiline functionality working (133 total characters) ✅ URL counter and form validation working ✅ Complete integration with main app via callback system. This architectural solution can be applied to other input areas that experience similar issues. The affiliate marketing platform now has professional-grade input handling for the critical URL management feature."
